bedbugs are a sub species of blockings, a species of sentient objects and blocks, bedbugs are known for being able to fly and being practically immortal with their ability to respawn after death, a rare trait most blocklings dont have. Bebdugs are usually found deep underground to avoid the day night cycle, they do not need to eat but sometimes photosynthesising, bedbugs were also known for being voilent creatures back in the past before they went into hiding.

## weaknesses

bedbugs dont have many weaknesses due to being immortal but you can easily slow them down by going fast, bedbugs are quite slow. and make sure they are seperated at all times, the more there are, the strogner they are
