Voidlings are humanoid-like creatures that evolved throughout millions of years in the void, but in the last thousand years, they have slowly started to colonize the surface of Asden. The environment is far from save though, as they easily catch fire if they don't wear head protection. Most Voidlings seem to prefer forests as their environment of choice for creating structures to live in.

## Weaknesses

Most Voidlings are known for their weak heart, as survival in the void was easy with close to no predators. Due to this, their bloodflow is also slower, causing them to be able to go without a heart for up to 30 seconds, while still conscious. Once a Voidling has bled out, there's a 5 minute time frame to resurrect them, however, most of the time, no one manages to do so.
